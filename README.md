# arduinoTwitterBot
Literal twitter bot to show off at the SCC Makerspace's Grand Opening.  

Currently the Raspberry Pi will read from the hashtag #sccmakes and print the most recent message to the LCD screen via the Arduino.  It will alternate between this and reading commands tweeted @sccmakerbot and responding to them (both via twitter and servo motors on the Arduino).  Surprisingly, the whole operation can run off of one backup battery cellphone charger.   The available commands are 'move', 'left', 'right', and 'stop.'
